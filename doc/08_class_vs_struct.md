# class vs struct

The differences between a class and a struct in C++ is:

`class`:
- `class` members and base classes/struts are **private by default**.
- use `class` when you make use of features such as private or protected members, non-default constructors and operators, etc.

`struct`:
- `struct` members and base classes/structs are **public by default**.
- use `struct` for plain-old-data structures without any class-like features;
